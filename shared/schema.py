# Design rules (from BRIEF_SEEK.md and AGENTS.md):
#   * The Python side emits RAW STRUCTURED DATA and formats nothing for display.
#     No human-readable sizes, speeds, durations, percentages or labels appear
#     anywhere in this schema. Bytes are bytes, seconds are seconds.
#   * Every field that upstream can fail to provide is nullable, and is null
#     rather than 0/"" so the frontend can distinguish "absent" from "zero".
#   * Nothing here is derived. No format tier, no quality score, no dedup key,
#     no transcode verdict. All of that is `app/src/domain/`.

# The type mini-language used below:
#   "str" "int" "float" "bool" "json"   primitives ("json" = opaque any)
#   "Foo"                               reference to a STRUCT or ENUM
#   "T?"                                nullable (T | null)
#   "T[]"                               array of T (arrays are never nullable;
#                                       absent means empty)
# Suffixes compose right-to-left: "Foo[]?" is a nullable array, "Foo?[]" is not
# expressible and is rejected by the generator.
