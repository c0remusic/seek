/*
 * Seek — transfers, both directions.

 *
 * ONE STREAM, TWO LISTS. Downloads and uploads arrive on the same
 * `transfer.*` events carrying a `direction`, because they are the same kind
 * of thing and group the same way — a peer fetching a whole folder from you is
 * a release just as much as one you are fetching. They are split here rather
 * than in the sidecar, and the id carries the direction so the two can never
 * collide (`registries.transfer_key`).
 *
 * `groups`, `all` and `activeCount` are the DOWNLOAD half, because every
 * existing caller means downloads by them — the sidebar badge, the notifier,
 * the command palette. Uploads are `uploadGroups` and `uploadCount`.
 *
 * docs/PRODUCT.md §7: a download is a RELEASE, not a row per file. The sidecar
 * emits one Transfer per file because that is what the protocol does; grouping
 * them back into releases is this file's job, and it is the same discipline as
 * everywhere else — Python emits raw facts, TypeScript decides how they read.
 *
 * Grouping key is the remote parent folder, which is also what the peer used to
 * organise them, so it survives paths that carry no usable metadata.
 *
 * `transfer.updated` arrives roughly once a second per active transfer, so
 * state is held in a ref and published on a throttled tick. Re-rendering the
 * whole list per packet is exactly the jitter the brief forbids.
