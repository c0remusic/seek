 * Two settings stores exist and the split is deliberate:
 *
 *   `prefsStore`   Seek's preferences — quality rules, artwork, API keys.
 *                  Lives in `<dataFolder>/seek-state.json`, which Seek owns.
 *   this file      pynicotine's configuration — where files land, which port
 *                  listens, speed limits, slots, what is shared. Lives in the
 *                  Nicotine+ config, because upstream reads it from there and
 *                  nowhere else.
 *
 * Every command here already existed in the sidecar and was tested; nothing in
 * the UI had ever called one. `settings.get`, `settings.patch`, `shares.get`,
 * `shares.set` and `shares.rescan` were all reachable from a socket and from
 * no screen, which is why someone who had never used Nicotine+ had no way to
 * say where their downloads should go.
 *
 * Unlike `prefsStore`, saving here is NOT optimistic. A toggle can echo
 * locally because it cannot fail; a folder can, and a field that shows the new
 * path for half a second before snapping back to the old one — with the reason
 * arriving separately — is worse than one that simply waits.
