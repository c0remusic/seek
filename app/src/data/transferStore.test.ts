 * Giving up on a quiet download, and — the half that actually matters —
 * un-giving-up on it.
 *
 * Iva asked for stalled downloads to be swept into Failed on a timer, and chose
 * that they be RECLASSIFIED rather than cancelled: the transfer is not touched,
 * so it keeps its place in the peer's queue, which on Soulseek is often hours
 * long and frequently does come good.
 *
 * That choice is what makes the direction tests below the point of this file. A
 * stored "gave up" flag would satisfy every forward test here and still be
 * wrong, because nothing would ever clear it and a download that recovered
 * would sit in Failed for the rest of the session. The classification has to be
 * a pure derivation of "how long since this moved", and the only way to pin
 * that is to move it and watch the group come back.
