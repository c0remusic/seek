 * sight of a whole side of the app: there is no upload view (backlog 2a), yet
 * the engine has been serving peers and counting the bytes the entire time.
 *
 * Two halves. `session` resets when the sidecar starts; `total` persists in
 * the pynicotine config with a `sinceTimestamp`. Showing both costs nothing
 * and answers two different questions — "is it working right now" and "what
 * has this account actually done".
 *
 * The event is rate-limited on the sidecar side, because upstream emits its
 * own `update-stat` once per FRAGMENT per transfer. See `STATS_MIN_INTERVAL`
 * in core_host.py.
