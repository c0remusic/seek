 *
 * WHAT A TAB IS, and what it deliberately is not.
 *
 * One search runs at a time. That is the transport's rule rather than a choice
 * made here: `sidecar.start()` replaces the previous search's handlers, because
 * the client models a single running search (see connectionStore.ts). So a tab
 * is not a second engine — it is a search PUT AWAY, with everything needed to
 * bring it back: its files, its filters, its grouping, its sort, what was
 * expanded, and why it stopped.
 *
 * The thing that was actually asked for is that a new search stop destroying
 * the last one. Before this, the single field replaced the results and they
 * were gone. Now they are a tab, and going back to it is exact.
 *
 * THE ONE LIMITATION, stated rather than hidden: leaving a tab whose search is
 * still streaming stops it. It has to — the next thing that starts takes the
 * transport — so the tab you left keeps the results it had at that moment and
 * reports that it was stopped. A search runs for about thirty seconds, so this
 * is the corner rather than the common case, but a tab that quietly lost its
 * tail would be worse than one that says so.
