 * Iva's ask: "save labels and work through their catalogues over time, rather
 * than pasting a link and losing it when the card is dismissed." `catalogStore`
 * holds exactly ONE catalogue, in React state, and browsing a second replaces
 * the first — which is right for the Dig Bar and is precisely the losing this
 * fixes.
 *
 * IT IS NOW ALSO A NEW-RELEASE NOTIFIER, and that reverses an argument this
 * file used to make. Worth recording why, because two of the three original
 * objections were answered and one was simply accepted:
 *
 *   "Discogs is a database, not a release feed, so diffing it reports records
 *   catalogued decades late as new." Answered: a Discogs entry has to be
 *   recent by its own YEAR as well as unseen.
 *
 *   "Bandcamp has no API to poll." Answered, and it turned out to be the
 *   cheaper half — its whole catalogue is one HTML page, newest first.
 *
 *   "A brand-new release is the one thing Soulseek does not have yet, so the
 *   notification's happy path ends in an empty search." NOT answered. This is
 *   still true. Iva asked for the feature knowing it.
 *
 * Back catalogue is still what this is FOR. The notifier is an addition to a
 * bookmark, not a replacement for one.
 *
 * THE COUNTS ARE A SNAPSHOT. `sessionStore` deliberately derives its counts
 * from the want list rather than storing them, because storing a number twice
 * is two places for it to be wrong — but that works only because the frontend
 * holds the whole want list. A catalogue is persisted nowhere, and recounting
 * one costs several rate-limited HTTP requests per label, so these are stored
 * with the time they were taken and must always be rendered as "when you last
 * looked". `describeProgress` in `domain/labels.ts` is the only thing allowed
 * to word them.
