 * objects: the store, the adapter and every component below it are unchanged.
 *
 * Framing, from `sidecar/seek_sidecar/server.py`:
 *
 *   →  { id, cmd, params }
 *   ←  { id, ok: true,  result }
 *   ←  { id, ok: false, error: { code, message } }
 *   ←  { ev, data }                                  (unsolicited, no id)
 *
 * Auth is a `?token=` query parameter. A browser cannot set request headers on
 * a WebSocket, so `Authorization: Bearer` is unavailable to us — the sidecar
 * accepts both and prefers the header for clients that can send one.
 *
 * The sidecar also refuses any connection carrying an `Origin` header unless
 * that exact origin was passed to `--allow-origin`. Browsers always send one
 * and cannot suppress it, so running the UI from the Vite dev server needs
 * `--allow-origin http://localhost:5273`. A packaged Tauri build sends none and
 * needs nothing.
