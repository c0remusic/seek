 * One preview at a time, because there is one search field. Pasting a second
 * URL replaces the first rather than queueing it, and a reply for a request the
 * user has already moved past is dropped on arrival — the alternative is a card
 * that fills itself in with the answer to a question nobody is asking any more.
 *
 * The lookup is never on the critical path. `discover.parseUrl` replies with a
 * request id immediately and the answer arrives as an event, so the card shows
 * a skeleton from the first keystroke after the paste.
 *
 * WHERE THE PARSING HAPPENS. The sidecar sends raw provider facts. For Bandcamp
 * and Discogs that already includes artist and title; for YouTube it is one
 * free-text string, and `parseTitle` turns it into a suggestion here. That split
 * is the seam (AGENTS.md), and it is why `confidence` is computed in this file
 * rather than arriving on the wire.
