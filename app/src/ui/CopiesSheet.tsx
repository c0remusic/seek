 *
 * This replaces an automatic choice. The app used to rank the copies of a
 * release, download whichever it rated best, and tell you afterwards — and it
 * was measured handing over a 13-track copy from a stranger when a 9-track copy
 * had been clicked. Iva's instruction: "I don't want the app to choose what to
 * download, I need to see the data myself, and decide myself." So the ranking
 * survives as the ORDER of this list and nothing else. Every row here is inert
 * until it is clicked.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO, and this is load-bearing. Where an album is spread over
 * several peers, the useful-sounding thing to build is "take tracks 1-4 from
 * her and 5-13 from him". That needs the same track recognised across different
 * people's rips, and `docs/HANDOFF.md` §3 records it measured three ways on
 * real data: 46, then 146, then 186 picks for a 13-track record, because rips
 * disagree about numbering and filenames. So this sheet shows each copy's files
 * VERBATIM, exactly as that peer sent them, and never lines two copies up
 * against each other or says which files are "the same track". Reading across
 * them is the user's job, with the real strings in front of them; asserting the
 * match is what was wrong three times.
