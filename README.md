# Seek

**A Mac client for [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) built for people who dig.**
Paste a Discogs, Bandcamp or YouTube link and it becomes a search. Work through
a label's entire back catalogue. See what a file actually is before you keep it.

Built on [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/), which does the protocol work.

> **About the pictures.** The interface shots on this page are rendered from
> Seek's design file, which is built from the same tokens, type scale and icon
> set the app ships — so they show the real layout with sample records in it.
> The **spectrogram below is a real measurement from a real file**, and the
> install screenshots are real macOS dialogs; neither is a mock-up, because
> both are evidence rather than illustration.

> **Unofficial.** Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Soulseek or
> the Nicotine+ project. Seek uses Nicotine+ as a library and is grateful for it.

## Why not just use Nicotine+?

Nicotine+ is excellent and Seek runs on it. Seek is what happens when you point
that engine at one question: **how do you find a specific record, and know it is
the right one, without doing the bookkeeping yourself?**

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔗 **Records, not filenames** | Paste a link from Discogs, Bandcamp or YouTube. Seek reads the artist, title, year and tracklist off the page and searches for *that* — no retyping, no guessing at spelling. |
| 📚 **Whole catalogues** | Open a label's discography, see at a glance what you already own, and work down the list. Keep a watchlist of labels you're digging through. |
| 🔍 **Proof, not badges** | A "FLAC" that came from a 192 kbps MP3 is shown as one, with the spectrogram that says so. Seek shows its working instead of stamping a verdict. |
| 👤 **You pick the copy** | Several people have the record? You get a comparison — tracks, format, size, free slot, queue length, your own history with them. The app never quietly swaps your choice for one it prefers. |
| 🤝 **Sharing treated as the point** | Soulseek is reciprocal. Seek shows what you're uploading, what your ratio actually is, and says plainly when a slow queue is the consequence of sharing nothing. |
| 🚫 **It refuses to guess** | Where no one person has the whole album, Seek says so and shows what each person actually has, file by file. It won't claim one person's "track 4" is another's — that guess was measured against real data and was wrong more often than right. |

## The link features

This is the part that changes how you use Soulseek. **Paste any of these into
the search bar** and Seek reads it before you press Return.

### A label link → the whole roster

![Pasting a Discogs label link into Seek](docs/screenshots/link-discogs-label.png)

Drop in a Discogs label URL and Seek identifies the label, then offers to browse
its entire catalogue, start watching it, or add the lot to your want list.

> 🔑 **Discogs links need a free Discogs token.** [Set one up in 3 steps →](#discogs-token)
> Bandcamp label links work with **no key at all**.

### An album link → an exact search

![Pasting a Discogs album link into Seek](docs/screenshots/link-discogs-album.png)

Paste a release or master URL and Seek pulls the artist, title, year and track
count straight off the page — then searches Soulseek for that record, correctly
spelled, first time.

> 🔑 **Discogs** links need a [token](#discogs-token). **Bandcamp** album links and
> **YouTube** video links need **nothing** — they work the moment you install Seek.

### Browsing a catalogue

![Browsing the Apollo label catalogue](docs/screenshots/catalogue.png)

Seek already knows which ones are in your library. Filter down to
**"Not in my library"** and every row has a **Search** and a **Want** button.
On a label with a few hundred releases this is a whole afternoon of digging in
one screen.

> 🔑 **Discogs catalogues need a [token](#discogs-token). Bandcamp catalogues do not.**

### A watchlist of labels *and artists*

![The label and artist watchlist](docs/screenshots/watchlist.png)

The catalogues you're working through, with your progress on each — how many
releases, how many are on your want list, how many you've dealt with. Add a
note to yourself ("the 12″ singles first, skip the CD comps"). Sources are mixed
freely: Bandcamp and Discogs sit side by side.

**Artists count as catalogues too.** They always did — the engine accepted
either — but everything on screen said "labels", so half of what this screen
does was invisible unless you happened to try it. Filter to one or the other, or
read them together.

Each row carries the catalogue's own logo, pulled from Discogs or off the
Bandcamp page and stored inside Seek, never hot-linked. Switch to **Grid** and
the screen becomes a shelf of them.

**Check for new** looks for releases added since the last time you looked, and
badges the row with a count — *four new* is worth crossing the room for and
*one new* is worth knowing about later, which is why it is a number and not a
dot. It clears when you open the catalogue.

Nothing here refreshes itself, and the button is the reason. A Discogs
catalogue is several rate-limited requests, so a dozen watched entries checked
automatically would spend a minute and a half of someone else's API budget
without being asked. You press it.

> ⚠️ A brand-new release is, by definition, the one thing Soulseek is least
> likely to have yet. Some of these notifications will lead to an empty search.
> That is worth knowing before you turn it on rather than after.

> 🔑 Watching a **Discogs** catalogue needs a [token](#discogs-token). Watching a
> **Bandcamp** one needs nothing.

---

## Several searches at once

Every search opens its own **tab**. Going back to one restores it exactly — its
results, its filters, its grouping, what you had expanded. **⌘T** for a new one,
**⌘W** to close it, or the **+** above the field.

A tab is a search *put away*, not a second engine. Soulseek allows one search at
a time, so leaving a tab whose search is still streaming stops it — that tab
keeps the results it had and says it was stopped, rather than quietly losing the
rest. Tabs you queued a download from tidy themselves up after 45 minutes; the
one you're reading never disappears under you.

---

## Your collection, four ways

![The library as a grid of covers](docs/screenshots/library.png)

Point Seek at the folders you already have and it builds a library from them —
then shows it **comfortable, compact, as a table, or as a grid**. Covers are how
you pick through a shelf; the table gives you release, artist, tracks, size,
format and year in aligned columns for auditing what you own.

Artwork is fetched only for what's on screen, so a collection of thousands
doesn't queue thousands of lookups to draw twenty. Where no artwork exists — and
for most underground releases none ever will — you get a mark derived from the
release name, the same one every time, so the shelf stays readable instead of
turning into rows of identical grey squares.

Everything you own is cross-referenced against every catalogue you browse, which
is what makes **"not in my library"** a one-click filter.

---

## Know what you actually downloaded

![Track analysis showing a lowpass at 16.6 kHz](docs/screenshots/analysis.png)

A file can claim any quality it likes. Seek looks at the **sound itself** —
frequency against time, loudness as colour — and tells you what it found.

That flat cliff at 16.6 kHz is an encoder ceiling: everything above it was thrown
away, which is what a lossy encoder does. Seek reads it as *"typical of a source
around 192 kbps"* and, crucially, labels its own confidence — here
**Inconclusive, 15%**. It reports what it saw, not what to think.

> ✅ **No key needed.** This runs entirely on your Mac. Nothing is uploaded, and
> it works offline.

Also here: **Preview** before you commit, **Fix tags**, and **Organise** to file
the release where it belongs.

---

## Sharing, shown honestly

![Uploads, with filters and sorting](docs/screenshots/uploads.png)

Soulseek is reciprocal, and Seek treats that as the point rather than an
afterthought. You can see what you're uploading, to whom, and what your ratio
actually is — filtered and sorted the same way your downloads are, because it is
the same list going the other way.

It will also tell you plainly when a slow queue is the consequence of sharing
nothing. That is usually the answer, and no other client says it.

---

## Install

Download the `.zip` from [**Releases**](../../releases), unzip it, and drag
`Seek.app` to your Applications folder.

macOS will block it the first time. Seek isn't signed with a paid Apple
Developer certificate ($99/year), so macOS quarantines it like anything else off
the internet. **Three clicks, once, and then it opens normally forever.**

### 1. Open Seek — macOS refuses. Click **Done**.

![macOS blocking Seek on first open](docs/screenshots/install-1-blocked.png)

Do *not* click Move to Trash. Just Done.

### 2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, and click **Open Anyway**

![Open Anyway in Privacy and Security](docs/screenshots/install-2-privacy.png)

Scroll to the **Security** section. You'll see *"Seek.app was blocked to protect
your Mac"* with an **Open Anyway** button beside it. That message only appears
after step 1, so don't go looking for it first.

### 3. Confirm with **Open Anyway**

![Confirming Open Anyway](docs/screenshots/install-3-open-anyway.png)

That's it. Seek opens by double-click from now on.

<details>
<summary><b>Prefer one Terminal command instead?</b></summary>

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Seek.app
```

It prints nothing when it works, and replaces all three steps above. It removes
the "came from the internet" tag macOS attached to the download and changes
nothing about the app itself.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Seeing "Seek is damaged and can't be opened"?</b></summary>

That means you have a build from before **26 Aug 2026**, and the build is the
problem rather than your Mac. Its bundle was linker-signed — the signature
covered the executable but sealed none of the resources — and Gatekeeper reads
that as corruption rather than as an untrusted app, which is why no **Open
Anyway** appears anywhere.

Download a current release. `release.sh` now refuses to produce a build that way.

</details>

**What you need:** a Soulseek account. Seek doesn't create one — sign in under
**Settings → Account**, or import an existing setup from Nicotine+.

### Updates are automatic

**You only do the above once.** Seek checks for a new version on launch and
offers to install it — one click, no Terminal, no System Settings, no dragging
anything anywhere.

The reason that works: the approval you just gave is recorded against *that
specific copy* of the app, so replacing it by hand would mean repeating all
three steps every time. A download the app makes itself is never quarantined,
so an in-app update skips Gatekeeper entirely.

Each update is signed with a key that never leaves the release pipeline, and
Seek verifies that signature before writing a single byte — so a compromised
download server still cannot push you a build. Nothing installs without you
choosing to; if you're mid-download, "Not now" is a real answer and the offer
comes back next launch.

## Setting up the API keys

Seek works out of the box. These unlock the features above, they're all **free**,
and each one takes a couple of minutes.

Everything is stored in Seek's own data folder, never in this repository, and
only ever leaves your Mac to reach the service it belongs to.

**All of them go in the same place: `Settings → External lookups`.**

| What you want | What you need |
|---|---|
| Bandcamp links & catalogues | ✅ Nothing |
| YouTube video links | ✅ Nothing |
| Artwork and release data (MusicBrainz, Cover Art Archive) | ✅ Nothing |
| Track analysis / spectrograms | ✅ Nothing — runs locally |
| **Discogs links, catalogues, want list import** | 🔑 [Discogs token](#discogs-token) |
| **Import a YouTube playlist** | 🔑 [YouTube Data API key](#youtube-data-api-key) |
| **Identify a file by its sound** | 🔑 [AcoustID key](#acoustid-application-key) |

---

### Discogs token

The one most worth doing — Discogs is the database that actually knows
underground electronic releases.

1. Go to **[discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com/)** and sign in. (Free to
   create an account if you don't have one.)
2. Open **[discogs.com/settings/developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers)**.
3. Find the section headed **Personal access token** and press
   **Generate new token**.
4. **Copy the token** it shows you — a long string of letters and numbers.
5. In Seek: **Settings → External lookups → Discogs token**, paste it, and save.

That's all. A personal token is tied to your own account and needs no app
registration or approval. Discogs allows 60 requests a minute with one; Seek
stays well under that.

---

### YouTube Data API key

Only needed to **import a playlist**. Pasting a single YouTube video link works
without it.

1. Go to **[console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)** and
   sign in with any Google account.
2. **Create a project.** Click the project dropdown in the top bar → **New
   Project** → give it any name ("Seek" is fine) → **Create**. Wait a few
   seconds, then make sure it's the selected project.
3. **Enable the API.** In the sidebar go to **APIs & Services → Library**,
   search for **"YouTube Data API v3"**, click it, and press **Enable**.
4. **Make the key.** Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials** →
   **Create credentials** → **API key**.
5. **Copy the key** it shows you.
6. In Seek: **Settings → External lookups → YouTube Data API key**, paste, save.

> ⚠️ Choose **API key**, not an OAuth client. OAuth is for reaching a Google
> account's *private* data — a public playlist needs none of it. Seek holds no
> client secret and never asks you to sign in to Google.

Optionally, click your new key and restrict it to the YouTube Data API. Google's
free tier is far more than Seek will ever use.

---

### AcoustID application key

Only needed to **identify an unlabelled file by its sound**.

1. Register an account at **[acoustid.org](https://acoustid.org/login)** (you can
   sign in with an existing account from another service).
2. Go to **[acoustid.org/new-application](https://acoustid.org/new-application)**
   and register an application. Any name will do — "Seek" or "personal use".
3. Copy the **API key shown for that application**.
4. In Seek: **Settings → External lookups → AcoustID application key**, paste,
   save.

> ⚠️ **Use the APPLICATION key, not the API key on your profile page.** They look
> identical and the wrong one silently fails. The profile key is for *submitting*
> fingerprints, and AcoustID rejects it for lookups — but the rejection arrives
> as an empty result rather than an error, so it just looks like nothing matched.
> This cost an hour to work out while building Seek; now you don't have to.

The fingerprinting tool itself (`fpcalc`) ships inside Seek — you don't need to
install anything. Only the free AcoustID key is required.

## Build from source

An app you build yourself is never quarantined, so this skips the install dance
entirely.

**You'll need:** macOS (Apple silicon or Intel), [Rust](https://rustup.rs/),
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+, and Python 3.11+.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <this repo>
cd seek

# the Python engine. The dev set, not just the runtime one: the release
# scripts run the tests and PyInstaller, and both live in requirements-dev.
cd sidecar
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cd ..

# the app
cd app
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

The finished app lands in
`app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Seek.app`.

`--recurse-submodules` matters: Nicotine+ is pinned as a submodule so a build is
reproducible. Without it the engine has nothing to talk to.

## Development

```bash
cd sidecar && PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=../upstream:. \
  .venv/bin/python -m seek_sidecar --print-endpoint --allow-origin http://localhost:5273
cd app && npm run dev
```

The engine prints a host, port and token; open
`http://localhost:5273/?sidecar=127.0.0.1:<port>&token=<token>`.

```bash
cd app && npm test          # 341 tests
cd app && npm run typecheck
cd sidecar && PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=../upstream:. \
  .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -q # 494 tests
```

`./release.sh` does a full release build, and refuses to continue if the frozen
engine would ship stale code, a bundle without its CA certificates, or an update
signed with a key that installed copies would reject.

`RECON.md` documents what the Soulseek protocol actually provides — several
things the obvious assumption gets wrong — and `docs/PRODUCT.md` is the product
spec. Both are worth reading before changing anything at the seam between the
Python engine and the TypeScript frontend.

## Reporting a bug

Open an [issue](../../issues/new/choose). The form asks for three things, all
of which are on **Settings → About**: the Seek version, your macOS version, and
the **log file** path.

Seek keeps a diagnostic log on your machine. It records what Seek itself did —
not what you searched for, and not who you exchanged files with — and your home
folder appears as `~` rather than your real name. Nothing reads it back and
nothing uploads it; it only ever leaves your Mac if you attach it yourself.

> Two files live near it that you should **not** send: `seek-state.json` holds
> your API keys in plain text, and the `logs/` folder is your private Soulseek
> chat history, which has nothing to do with Seek's own logging.

## Your responsibility

Seek is a client. What you search for, share and download is up to you, and so
is complying with the law where you live.

## Licence

GPL-3.0-or-later. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Seek uses [Nicotine+](https://github.com/nicotine-plus/nicotine-plus)
(GPL-3.0-or-later) as its protocol engine, pinned as a submodule. Because a
packaged build embeds Nicotine+, the corresponding source for everything in the
app is this repository plus that pinned submodule.

A packaged build also ships **`fpcalc`** from
[Chromaprint](https://github.com/acoustid/chromaprint) 1.6.1
(LGPL-2.1-or-later), used to fingerprint a file for AcoustID. It is the
official universal macOS build, shipped **unmodified** and run as a separate
program — Seek never links against it. Its source is
[chromaprint-1.6.1.tar.gz](https://github.com/acoustid/chromaprint/releases/tag/v1.6.1),
and `sidecar/fetch-fpcalc.sh` records the exact artifact and its checksum. That
binary statically links [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), also under
LGPL-2.1-or-later.
