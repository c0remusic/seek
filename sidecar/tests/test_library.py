# The library only ever scanned the download folder, because the one way to add
# another was a drag-and-drop handler that cannot fire in a Tauri v2 webview.
# With a real folder picker in front of it, OVERLAPPING roots stop being exotic
# and become the obvious thing a person does: the download folder is always
# included, and the first folder anyone adds is the music folder containing it.
#
# `os.walk` does not care that it has been here before, and `trackCount += 1`
# runs again — so the collection reports twice what you own, from a pair of
# folders that are both perfectly reasonable. These tests pin that it does not.
