Seek — your own Soulseek profile.

THE TRAP, measured before anything was written: upstream stores the profile
description as a Python `repr()` and calls `unescape()` on it when sending it
to a peer. Only `gtkgui/dialogs/preferences.py:1287` writes the field, and it
writes `repr(text)`.

Storing the raw string instead is silently destructive, and only for some
inputs — which is the worst kind:

    stored `C:\\newfolder\\test`  ->  unescape ->  `C:` NEWLINE `ewfolder` TAB `est`
    stored `'quoted'`           ->  unescape ->  `quoted`   (quotes eaten)
    stored `plain text`         ->  unescape ->  `plain text`  (fine — so a
                                                  casual test would pass)

These pin the round trip on exactly those shapes.
