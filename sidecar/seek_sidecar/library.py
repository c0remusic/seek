# The vision note §13: knowing the collection is what turns a downloader into a
# collection tool. Two things fall out of it immediately — "you already have
# this" while searching, and eventually "which releases am I missing".
#
# DESIGN NOTES.
#
# Tags first, path second. A downloaded file's tags are often wrong or absent
# (that is why the metadata repair exists), but when they are present they beat
# any guess from a filename. So read tags where cheap, and fall back to the
# folder/filename shape the rest of the app already parses.
#
# The index is a flat JSON file, not SQLite. It is a few MB for a large
# collection, written once per scan and read once at startup, and a database
# would be more moving parts for a workload with no queries beyond "is this key
# present".
#
# Scanning is IO-bound and can take minutes over a network volume, so it runs on
# a worker thread and reports progress. It must never block the protocol loop.
