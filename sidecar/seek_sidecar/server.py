#
# Runs an asyncio WebSocket server on its own thread and marshals frames to and
# from the pynicotine main thread.
#
# SECURITY. This socket can enqueue downloads and rewrite settings, so it is not
# a debug endpoint:
#
#   * Bound to a loopback address only. Never 0.0.0.0. Enforced, not documented
#     — `_assert_loopback` rejects anything else at construction.
#   * Requires a token the Tauri shell generates at spawn and passes to both
#     sides. Any browser page on the machine can open a ws:// connection to
#     localhost; the token is what stops a random tab from queueing downloads.
#   * The token is compared with hmac.compare_digest, not ==, so it cannot be
#     recovered a byte at a time by timing the handshake.
#   * The Origin header is rejected unless it exactly matches one passed to
#     `--allow-origin`. NOTE: every client sends one — this was originally
#     written believing a packaged desktop webview sent none, and that is
#     false. WKWebView reports `tauri://localhost` for a bundled Tauri app, and
#     the Vite dev server's origin under `tauri dev`. The Tauri shell therefore
#     passes `--allow-origin` itself; without it the sidecar 403s its own
#     frontend forever and the app looks permanently offline.
#
#     The check still earns its place: it pins connections to the one origin the
#     app actually runs from, so a random page the user has open cannot drive
#     the socket even if the token leaked. There is deliberately no wildcard —
#     the token is the real gate, but an unbounded origin list discards the
#     second lock for nothing.
#   * Frames are size-capped before parsing so a malformed client cannot make
#     the sidecar allocate without bound.
#
# The token may be supplied as a `?token=` query parameter (which is how a
# WebSocket client can authenticate before the connection is established) or an
# `Authorization: Bearer` header. Query strings can end up in logs, so the
# header is preferred and the sidecar never logs the request target.
