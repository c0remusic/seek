# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# RECON.md §4 established that the metadata transcode check cannot run on
# lossless files. The Soulseek protocol sends no bitrate for FLAC/WAV/AIFF
# (FileListMessage.pack_file_info only sends BITRATE for lossy files), so there
# is no advertised claim to contradict. The feature BRIEF_SEEK.md called the
# project's justification structurally does not work on the format the target
# user cares most about.
#
# Spectral analysis closes exactly that gap. Lossy encoders apply a lowpass
# filter — MP3 at 128 kbps discards everything above roughly 16 kHz, 320 kbps
# above roughly 20 kHz. That filter survives re-encoding to FLAC. A sharp shelf
# at 16 kHz in a file claiming to be lossless is evidence of an MP3 source, and
# it requires no cooperation from the uploader's metadata.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT
#
# It is not proof, and this module never says it is. Quiet, sparse, old or
# deliberately dark recordings genuinely lack high-frequency energy; a 1968
# analogue master has a rolloff that is not an encoder's fault. So:
#
#   * The shelf must be SHARP to count. Sharpness (drop over width) is weighted
#     more heavily than the cutoff frequency itself, because a gentle acoustic
#     rolloff and an encoder cliff can share a cutoff and mean opposite things.
#   * Confidence is reported and is meant to be shown.
#   * The vocabulary tops out at "strong signs of a lossy source". There is
#     deliberately no "fake" value in SpectralAssessment.
#
# Approach credited to Spek (GPLv3), which visualises exactly this. Not vendored
# — we need decode plus FFT, a few hundred lines against numpy, not an
# application with a GUI.
#
# Everything returned is raw measurement. No labels, no colours, no formatted
# strings. Rendering is the frontend's job.
