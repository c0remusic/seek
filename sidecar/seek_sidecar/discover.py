#
# One job: given a URL the user pasted, ask the provider what it is and return
# RAW FACTS. This module does not decide what an artist is called. For Bandcamp
# and Discogs it does not have to — both return structured fields — and for
# YouTube it must not, because YouTube supplies one free-text title written by
# whoever uploaded the video, and reading an artist out of that is a derivation.
# Derivations live in `app/src/domain/parseTitle.ts` (AGENTS.md, "the seam").
#
# WHY THIS LIVES IN THE SIDECAR, same three reasons as enrich.py. A webview
# cannot set a `User-Agent` (it is on fetch's forbidden-header list), Discogs
# wants a descriptive one and an `Authorization` header, and every one of these
# services rate-limits. It also keeps the Discogs token on the side of the seam
# that already owns it: the token never crosses the socket, in either direction.
#
# RATE LIMITS, and they are not guesses:
#   YouTube oEmbed  no documented limit and no key; Google does not meaningfully
#                   throttle it. Ungated.
#   Bandcamp        no API and therefore no documented limit. Gated at 1/sec
#                   anyway: we are reading their public pages as a guest, and
#                   behaving like one is how this keeps working.
#   Discogs         60 requests/minute authenticated. Gated at 1/sec, which is
#                   exactly that ceiling.
#
# NOTE ON BANDCAMP. `DISCOVERY.md` specifies an oEmbed endpoint that does not
# exist — see the long comment on `parse_bandcamp`. Its release pages carry
# schema.org structured data instead, which is more useful and more fragile.
#
# PRIVACY. Everything here is gated by the caller on `externalLookups`. Off means
# off, including the artwork thumbnail — see `_image_data_uri` for why the image
# is fetched here rather than linked for the webview to load.
