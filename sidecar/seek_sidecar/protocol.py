'rejected' is the peer refusing, and it exists because upstream writes the
refusal STRAIGHT INTO `transfer.status` (downloads.py,
`_abort_transfer(download, status=reason)`). Those strings are
TransferRejectReason values - 'File not shared.', 'Banned', 'Pending
shutdown.' - and peers also send free text, e.g. anything starting 'User
limit of'. None of them are TransferStatus values, so mapping only the
closed set turned every refusal into 'unknown' AND discarded what the peer
actually said. That is what a download reading 'unknown' in 0.2.1 meant:
someone told you why and Seek threw it away.

For 'rejected' the reason is carried verbatim in `Transfer.error`. 'unknown'
now means only what it says - upstream had no status at all, which happens
for a restored transfer whose saved row predates the field.

    """
    A label or artist whose catalogue the user is working through.

    A bookmark with progress on it, and SINCE 0.2.7 also a new-release
    notifier — which reverses what this comment used to say. Two of the
    three objections were answered; the third was accepted:

      Discogs is a database rather than a release feed, so diffing it
      would report records catalogued decades late as 'new'. Answered:
      a Discogs entry must be recent by its own year as well as unseen.

      Bandcamp has no API to poll. Answered, and it is the cheaper half:
      its whole catalogue is one HTML page, newest first.

      A brand-new release is precisely what Soulseek does not have yet,
      so the notification's happy path ends in an empty search. NOT
      answered — still true, and accepted deliberately.

    Back catalogue remains what this is for.

    THE COUNTS ARE A SNAPSHOT, and unlike DigSession they are stored
    rather than derived. DigSession omits its counts because the frontend
    holds the whole want list and can recount at will; a catalogue is
    NOT persisted anywhere, so these cannot be recomputed without several
    rate-limited HTTP requests per label. They are therefore written when
    the catalogue is actually read, carry `lastSeenAt`, and must never be
