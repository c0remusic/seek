# a test runner __main__ is the runner, and the child re-runs the whole suite.

# filesystem to the Soulseek network. Doing that implicitly, before Seek has a
# Settings UI where the user picks what to share, is not a default the sidecar
# gets to choose.

# There is a real cost to leaving it off. Soulseek is a reciprocal network and a

        `user_logged_off`, returns to `queued` when they come back, and fails
        again on the next disconnect — for as long as it sits in the queue.

        Measured on a real config before this was fixed: four peers holding
        stuck queued transfers had accumulated 524, 522, 438 and 161 "failures"
        between them, against 381 downloads ever STARTED on the whole account.
        1,792 failures out of 381 attempts is impossible on its face, and the
        peer chip had been reporting "0 of 524 with you" — a claim about the
        user's own history that was simply untrue. Worse, it is a scoring
        input: `reliabilityFrom` sank those peers to the bottom of every
        source list on evidence that did not exist.

        So the outcome is remembered on the RECORD, and a transfer contributes
        once. A transfer already counted as failed that later finishes moves
        its count rather than adding to it — a retry that works is not a
