# Signing, and the permission prompt that keeps coming back

## The problem

Every time Seek updates, macOS asks again for permission to read the Downloads
folder.

**This is not a permissions bug. It is a signing consequence**, and it is a
different mechanism from the quarantine / "unidentified developer" dance that
`lib.rs` already solves — which is why that fix does nothing for it.

`app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` sets:

```json
"macOS": { "signingIdentity": "-" }
```

`-` means **ad-hoc**: signed, but with no certificate behind it. Verified
against a real build:

```
$ codesign -dvvv Seek.app
flags=0x10002(adhoc,runtime)
Signature=adhoc
TeamIdentifier=not set
Internal requirements count=0
```

`TeamIdentifier=not set` and `Internal requirements count=0` mean macOS has no
certificate-anchored identity for this app. The only thing identifying it is the
**CDHash** — a hash of the code itself. Every release is new code, so a new
hash, so TCC concludes it is different software and asks again.

The process that actually touches the folder is the **Python sidecar**
(`Contents/Resources/sidecar/seek-sidecar`), which runs pynicotine's
`downloads.py`. The prompt is attributed to Seek.app because the sidecar is a
bare executable with no bundle identity of its own.

## The fix being attempted, and its honest status

**One self-signed certificate, created once and reused forever.**

The theory: a certificate gives `codesign` something stable to anchor a
designated requirement to, instead of falling back to a raw content hash — which
should be enough for TCC to match successive builds.

**This is unverified.** It is plausible and free; it is not established. The only
thing that settles it is the two-build test at the bottom of this file. A green
build proves nothing here.

The certain fix is a paid Apple Developer ID ($99/year), which also removes the
`xattr` dance on first install. The roadmap for that is already written at the
foot of `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

---

## 1. Create the certificate — once, ever

**The one in use was made with `openssl`, not Certificate Assistant.** The GUI
is fine, but two of its defaults are wrong and one of them cannot be undone
later, so the exact recipe is recorded here instead of a click path:

```bash
cat > req.cnf <<'CNF'
[req]
distinguished_name = dn
prompt = no
x509_extensions = v3_codesign

[dn]
CN = Seek Self Signed
C  = GE

[v3_codesign]
keyUsage             = critical, digitalSignature
extendedKeyUsage     = critical, codeSigning
subjectKeyIdentifier = hash
CNF

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -days 7300 -noenc \
  -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -config req.cnf
```

Those three extensions — and the absence of `basicConstraints` — are exactly
what Certificate Assistant's *Self Signed Root* + *Code Signing* template
produces, confirmed by dumping the certificate it made before replacing it.

**What the defaults get wrong**, if you use the GUI anyway (tick *Let me
override defaults*):

| Default | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| **365-day validity** | `codesign` refuses an expired certificate, and replacing it is a NEW IDENTITY — the one thing this file exists to avoid. `-days 7300` is 20 years |
| **Email pre-filled from your Apple ID** | It lands in the certificate subject and ships inside every build, readable by anyone running `codesign -dvvv` on Seek.app |

The current certificate:

```
subject=CN=Seek Self Signed, C=GE          (no email)
notBefore=Aug 30 13:31:13 2026 GMT
notAfter =Aug 25 13:31:13 2046 GMT
sha1     =DA:F5:A5:4F:5E:BD:AD:2F:FC:60:FF:11:B9:C4:1F:8F:20:98:70:D9
```

> **Never regenerate it.** A new certificate is a new identity, and every user is
> back to being prompted on their next update — the exact problem this exists to
> fix. If it is ever lost, that is a real cost, so export a backup now and keep
> it somewhere you will still have in two years.

### Trust: not required, and the check that says otherwise is lying

A self-signed certificate is untrusted until you say so, and every obvious probe
reports that as failure:

```
$ security find-identity -v -p codesigning
     0 valid identities found
```

Drop `-v` — which filters to *valid* identities — and it appears, with the
reason:

```
$ security find-identity -p codesigning
  1) DA:F5:A5… "Seek Self Signed" (CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED)
```

**`codesign` signs with it regardless.** Measured, not assumed: a certificate
freshly imported into a keychain with no trust settings anywhere signed a binary
non-interactively, producing `Authority=Seek Self Signed`. Trust gates
*verification*, not the ability to sign — so **CI needs no trust step**, and
neither does `release.sh`.

Trust it locally only if you want `-v` to stop lying to you: Keychain Access →
*My Certificates* → *Seek Self Signed* → Trust → **Code Signing: Always Trust**.
It is a local keychain setting and says nothing about whether TCC matching
works; only the two-build test settles that.

Also always pass `-p codesigning`. Without it the default X.509 Basic policy
reports `0 valid identities found` for a perfectly good code-signing
certificate, for a second unrelated reason.

### Only ever one identity by this name

`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` is matched **by name**. While the superseded
certificate was still installed, a signing test "succeeded" against the wrong
one and reported a plausible `Authority=Seek Self Signed` — the result looked
like a pass and meant nothing. Delete the old one before testing a new one:

```bash
security delete-identity -Z <sha1> ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
```

## 2. Package it as a .p12

The certificate has to reach CI as a base64 `.p12` in a repository secret.

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -legacy -macalg sha1 \
  -inkey key.pem -in cert.pem -name "Seek Self Signed" \
  -out seek-signing.p12 -passout pass:"$PASS"
```

**`-legacy -macalg sha1` is load-bearing, and getting it wrong wastes an
afternoon.** OpenSSL 3 defaults the PKCS#12 MAC to SHA-256, which Apple's
`security import` cannot read. It fails like this:

```
security: SecKeychainItemImport: MAC verification failed during PKCS12 import
(wrong password?)
```

The password is **not** wrong. It is the MAC algorithm, and the error names the
one thing that is fine. Passing `-f pkcs12` to `security import` masks it —
which is exactly why it has to be right here: **Tauri does not pass `-f`**
(`crates/tauri-macos-sign/src/keychain.rs`), so a p12 that imports by hand can
still fail on CI.

If you exported from Keychain Access instead, you get Apple's own format, which
is fine but encrypted with `RC2-40-CBC` — so plain OpenSSL 3 refuses to read it
back and needs `-legacy` to inspect it. That too is the algorithm, not a corrupt
file.

### Verify before trusting it

A bad `.p12` fails on CI with nothing useful in the log, so prove it locally
first. The faithful check is Tauri's own sequence — note the keychain must be
added to the **search list**, or `codesign` cannot reach the private key and
blocks on a GUI prompt that never comes on a runner:

```bash
KC="$HOME/Library/Keychains/probe.keychain-db"
security create-keychain -p "$KCPASS" "$KC"
security unlock-keychain -p "$KCPASS" "$KC"
security import seek-signing.p12 -P "$PASS" -T /usr/bin/codesign -k "$KC"
security set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple:,codesign: -s -k "$KCPASS" "$KC"
security list-keychain -d user -s ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db "$KC"

cp /bin/echo probe-bin
codesign -f -s "Seek Self Signed" --keychain "$KC" --timestamp=none probe-bin
codesign -d --extract-certificates=xc probe-bin
openssl x509 -inform der -in xc0 -noout -subject -dates -fingerprint -sha1

security list-keychain -d user -s ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db   # RESTORE
security delete-keychain "$KC"
```

**Check the fingerprint, not just that it signed** — see "only ever one identity
by this name" above. And restore the search list unconditionally; leaving a
deleted keychain in it breaks signing on the machine in a way that is hard to
spot.

Then base64 it:

```bash
base64 -i seek-signing.p12 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
```

**`tr -d '\n'` matters** — the Rust base64 decoder on the other end rejects
embedded newlines.

That is now on your clipboard. **Do not paste it into a chat, an issue, or a
commit** — it is the private key.

## 3. Add three repository secrets

GitHub → the repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → **Actions** → *New
repository secret*:

| Secret | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | the base64 blob from step 2 |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | the password you set on the `.p12` |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | `Seek Self Signed` |

Set the password with no trailing newline — `printf '%s' "$PASS" | gh secret
set APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` — rather than relying on whatever the tool
trims. A password with a stray `\n` fails the import on CI and says only that
the import failed.

**The workflow imports the certificate itself, and deliberately does NOT export
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE` to the build.** This is the one thing here that is not
obvious, and it is what made the first v0.2.7 release fail with

```
failed to bundle project: failed codesign application: failed to resolve signing identity
```

Tauri has two paths, in `tauri-bundler/src/bundle/macos/sign.rs::keychain`:

| What it sees | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` + password | imports the `.p12`, then **enumerates** the keychain for a *valid* identity |
| only `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | hands the name straight to `codesign -s` |

The first path cannot work with a self-signed certificate. Enumeration is
`find-identity -v`, and an untrusted certificate is not a *valid* one — the same
`0 valid identities found` from step 1. The `.p12` imports fine (`1 identity
imported` appears in the log immediately before the failure); it is the lookup
afterwards that finds nothing.

The second path never looks. `codesign` signs perfectly well with an untrusted
certificate — measured on a fresh keychain with no trust settings anywhere — so
the workflow does the `security` dance and passes only the name.

**Do not "simplify" this back to exporting `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`.** It looks like
the obvious thing and it is the failing path.

One detail inside that dance is easy to lose: `Keychain::sign` only passes
`--keychain` when Tauri created the keychain itself, so on this path `codesign`
resolves the private key through the **user's keychain search list**. Leave the
new keychain out of the search list and `codesign` blocks on a GUI prompt that
no runner will ever answer — it does not error, it hangs until the job times
out.

The workflow also asserts the result: a build that was meant to be signed and
came out `Signature=adhoc` fails the run rather than shipping quietly.

**`tauri.conf.json` still says `"signingIdentity": "-"`, and that is correct.**
The environment variable wins; the config is the fallback. From the CLI source
at the pinned version, `crates/tauri-cli/src/interface/rust.rs:1467`:

```rust
let signing_identity = match std::env::var_os("APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY") {
  Some(signing_identity) => Some(…),
  None => config.macos.signing_identity,
};
```

So the secrets alone flip the build to signed, and a checkout with no secrets —
anyone building locally — stays ad-hoc exactly as before. Do not "fix" the `-`
to the certificate name: that would sign every local build with an identity the
machine does not have, and break the build for everyone else.

**The workflow already handles this.** `.github/workflows/release.yml` has a
conditional step that exports these only when they are present, so builds keep
working ad-hoc until the secrets exist. Nothing needs changing to turn it on.

## 4. Release as usual

```bash
git tag v0.2.8 && git push origin v0.2.8
```

Confirm the signature actually changed, on the downloaded app:

```bash
codesign -dvvv /Applications/Seek.app 2>&1 | grep -E "Signature|Authority|TeamIdentifier"
```

Ad-hoc says `Signature=adhoc`. Signed says `Authority=Seek Self Signed`. If it
still says `adhoc`, the secrets are not reaching the build — check the workflow
log for `no certificate configured`.

---

## 5. The test that actually settles it

**TCC cannot be faked or simulated. This has to be done on a real Mac, with two
real builds.**

1. Install the **first** signed build (call it A).
2. Point Settings → Folders → Downloads at your real `~/Downloads`.
3. Start a download. macOS prompts. **Allow it.**
4. Cut a second release (B) — any trivial change, so the code hash differs.
5. Update to B, either through the in-app updater or by replacing the app.
6. Start another download.

| What happens | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **No prompt** | It worked. A stable self-signed identity is enough for TCC. |
| **Prompted again** | It did not. The certificate is not enough, and only a Developer ID will fix it. |

There is no partial result and no interpreting required.

### If it fails

Say so plainly and stop — do not ship further changes pretending it helped. The
remaining options, in order:

1. **Apple Developer ID.** The only certain fix. Also removes the quarantine
   dance. $99/year plus notarisation in CI.
2. **Steer the folder away from protected locations.** pynicotine already
   defaults to `~/.local/share/nicotine/downloads`, which is not TCC-protected.
   Helps new users only; useless once someone has chosen their real Downloads.
3. **Accept and document it.** Costs nothing, changes nothing.

## Two things to expect either way

- **Existing users get ONE more prompt** on the upgrade from ad-hoc to signed.
  The identity changes at that moment, which is the whole point. It should be the
  last one.
- **Gatekeeper is untouched.** A self-signed certificate is not a trusted one, so
  the `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` instructions for fresh installs stay
  exactly as they are. Only a Developer ID removes those.

## Dead ends, already ruled out

- **`upstream/build-aux/macos/codesign-entitlements.plist`** — wrong domain
  entirely (hardened-runtime JIT exceptions, not the privacy service), and dead
  submodule baggage referenced only from a Windows setup script.
- **Full Disk Access** — keyed to the same unstable identity, so it would face
  the identical re-prompt while granting far broader access.
- **App Sandbox with security-scoped bookmarks** — Apple's real "never prompt
  again" mechanism, but it would need `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource`
  around every file operation inside a frozen Python binary with no ObjC
  bindings, while the Soulseek core does raw sockets and arbitrary folder
  scanning. Legitimate long-term direction; not a near-term fix.

---

## Windows

The Windows installer is **not Authenticode-signed**. SmartScreen therefore
interjects on first run ("Windows protected your PC") and the user clicks
**More info → Run anyway** — once. The README and the release notes both say
so in exactly those words, because an unexplained warning reads as danger and
an explained one reads as paperwork.

What signing would buy and cost: an OV Authenticode certificate (~$100–400/yr)
removes the warning only after enough installs build reputation; an EV
certificate (~$300–500/yr, hardware token) removes it immediately. Neither is
wired into the pipeline. When one exists, the place to add it is the `windows`
job of `release.yml` (signtool over the NSIS installer, after
`build-windows.sh`, before packaging) — nothing else changes, because the
in-app updater already verifies its own minisign signature and does not rely
on Authenticode at all.
